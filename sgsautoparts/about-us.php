<p>SGS Auto Parts has been operating in Thornleigh since February 2011. In November 2015 a large storage and <a href="https://a1expresscarremoval.com.au/car-removal-and-dismantling-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismantling facility</a> was added at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to establish our reputation for offering quality used parts combined with reliable, efficient delivery services. The addition of the larger storage facility has allowed us to expand our warehousing to hold parts for All Makes and Models while retaining our specialist inventory for Subaru and Volkswagen vehicles. We have a huge range of parts on the shelf, ready for immediate dispatch.</p>
<p>We are a member of the Parts Plus Group. Parts Plus is the largest quality auto parts recycling group in Australia and allows access to an additional combined inventory of millions of items for a wide range of passenger and commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>Our strong sales team has individual industry experience ranging from 12 to 30 plus years. This combined depth of knowledge allows SGS Auto Parts customers to be confident in the advice they receive and our ability to supply the correct quality used parts they require.</p>

<h4>ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY</h4>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>The <a href="<?php echo esc_url(site_url()) ?>/currently-dismantling/">Auto Dismantling Industry</a>&rsquo;s core business is to &lsquo;Reuse and Recycle. We all know that taking care of the environment is very important to the future of our planet and with motor vehicles consuming huge resources during the manufacturing process it is essential that these resources are safely given a chance at a second life.</p>
<p>Within our first year, SGS was proud to be one of the first auto dismantlers in NSW to be Awarded Level 3 Green Stamp Accreditation and we followed this up by winning the Green Stamp Environment Division at MTA Excellence in Business Awards shortly after. We consider compliance with industry regulations essential. In addition, we ensure processes are in place to manage the recycling of all remaining scrap after the dismantling process. This ranges from using imported equipment to safely handle waste fluids, to carefully separating any remaining items allowing these resources the best opportunity for reuse.</p>
